<!--Hello! My name is Sean Doyle. I grew up in Overland Park, KS, and I've always had an intense interest in programming, electronics, physics, math, and really anything science or tech. In my last two years of high school, I took science and math classes at my local community college to get a head start. Now, I have a greater diversity of interests, including philosophy, theology, Catholic liturgy, and music. This website displays some of my projects and other writings and thoughts that I've produced. It was created using Jekyll (Swiss theme) and Github Pages.-->

Sean Doyle is a programmer, a researcher, a reader, and a deep thinker. He is currently employed by [FAST Enterprises](https://www.fastenterprises.com) as a member of the Technical Team in Little Rock, AR. He is also a speaker, available to schools, youth groups, clubs, and other organizations and events, who discusses life, philosophy, science, and faith.

## Speaking Topics

### Pro-Life

| **You Don't Even Have a Uterus** | Men are often told that they have no place in the abortion discuss. Is this true? How can we as men *and* women respond to this argument? And even more, how can we be both pro-life *and* feminist? |
| **I Don't Want to Start an Argument** | Constructive dialogue with people who disagree with us is always difficult. Through my experiences talking to all kinds of people, I will give pointers on how we can get over our fear of other humans and spread the truth with kindness and boldness. |
| **Just a Clump of Cells** | Many people who are pro-choice have simply never heard a logical argument against abortion. In this talk I present the philosophical and scientific basis for the pro-life position, from a completely secular perspective. |
| **The&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;Himself&nbsp;Will&nbsp;Give&nbsp;You&nbsp;a&nbsp;Sign** | There are many religious people who are not sure whether they should support the pro-life movement. I will discuss how God reveals his love of life to us, how it is our duty as Christians to defend the unborn, and how the Church has *always* been pro-life. |

### Faith

| **Fides et Ratio** | What is the relationship between faith and reason, and between religion and science? Can you really believe in science *and* be Christian? And more than that, are there ways that science can positively *inform* religion, and vice versa? |
| **Who Shall Separate Us?** | "If God is for us, who is against us?" (Rom. 8:19)<br/> In this talk, I give my personal testimony on the saving power of God, and how he longs to set us all free. |
| **Breathing&nbsp;With&nbsp;Both&nbsp;Lungs** | Christianity contains a huge diversity of traditions, practices, and beliefs. We will explore the Church both East and West, as well as history, ecumenism, complementarity, and unity through the lens of St. John Paul II's *Ut Unum Sint*. |

I will happily take on other topics and suggestions
