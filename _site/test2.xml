<P class="p2 ft3">Twentieth Century propaganda, sustained through the decades by countless Hollywood productions, has condi- tioned us to believe that new regimes</P>
<P class="p3 ft4">arise through elaborate scams. Some sort of fake crisis, internal threat, <NOBR>war-mongering</NOBR> enemy, or faux economic hardship provides the excuse for an enterprising political genius to grab power. This political entrepreneur then wields the force of the state over and against the population that he suc- cessfully duped.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">This is not how it really happens. The power of particular men is limited by and operates within the will of the people who conform to its force. A new regime may attempt to shape this power, use it, or bend it in particular directions, but any sov- ereignty claimed by individual men is ultimately derivative. The tyrant is as much the puppet as the puppeteer. The basis of sustained power is in the souls of the dominated, their habits, their fear, their acquiescence. Real regime changes happen here.</P>
<P class="p5 ft4">We are witnessing regime change. It is not a conspiracy. The coronavirus is not a scam and the efforts to contain it are not a veil hiding the real power grab that is happening underneath. The problem is real and the old regime isn’t working.</P>
<P class="p6 ft4">The imperative to isolate, the imperative to social distance, is necessary exactly because we are already more isolated than ever before, because we are already more dissolved into a mass than any humans in history. Our very interchangeability is the condition of the virus’s devastation. The only solution that will “work” is to push forward to complete anonymity rather than back to social embeddedness; to families and communities. It is exactly our debt/consumption economic system that has made us so economically vulnerable, and the only solution that will “work” is to push</P>


<P class="p7 ft4">forward to the near total extinction of <NOBR>small-scale</NOBR> capital ownership. The only thing that will “work” is the reduction of the economy to businesses too big to fail and the extension of the State beyond the lingering pretext of the public/private binary. The final move to reduce society to the consuming individual and the <NOBR>capital-controlling</NOBR> <NOBR>State-Cor-</NOBR> porate conglomerate is what will “work.”</P>
<P class="p6 ft4">It will work, however, only because of the con- formity that constitutes its power. The new regime will not be imposed upon us by some scheming elite — that’s a libertarian fantasy. We will be the regime. Its sovereignty will come as much through the new social mores, manners, and moral judg- ments that will reward anonymity and scale while punishing community and intimacy as it will through any legal or economic apparatus. Our fear is real because the threat is real. And we will form the power necessary to assuage our fear. This power will include everything from explicit law to the meaning of virtue, to the vision of a good life, to what it means to be a responsible citizen, friend, or parent. Our new leaders’ power will be a participation in this power and not its source.</P>
<P class="p6 ft4">Understanding this allows us to understand how liberalism tricked us with fables of popular sovereignty, social contracts, and the consent of the governed — as if the very mechanisms through which all earthly power is wielded can somehow serve as the guarantee that power will be just and benevolent. Men are quite capable of enslaving themselves. The “consent of the gov- erned” may well include a wholehearted consent to misery and oppression under the rule of wealthy men playing god. Indeed, if we believe the Biblical account, that is how slavery comes into being: The power of the <NOBR>god-kings</NOBR> rested on the people’s fear of idols, whose power was nothing else than the people themselves.</P>

<P class="p9 ft4">But thanks be to God — the politics of fear and power are not our only option. The Bible is clear about what the lords of the nations can deliver, and it is not nothing. But it is also not true peace. True peace is only possible by going in the other direction, the direction taken by “the birds of the air” and “the lilies of the field.” Perhaps the coming regime will help Christians remember this. Such a remembrance will likely make us odious to the defenders of order. And they will largely be right. Christianity is a threat to the proper “working” of regimes of fear and power, as the New Testament makes clear. Chris- tianity is not yet another economy of power, yet another sovereignty competing on the field of battle. Christianity overcomes fear and power and undoes the mechanisms of slavery. This is why the Romans could not tolerate Christians. It is why the Early Modern Liberals excepted Catholicism from religions to be tolerated. They understood the implication of Christianity better than do most modern believers.</P>
<P class="p9 ft4">We are launching this magazine in order to do our bit toward overthrowing the idols of our age, to imagine a political order established in Christ, rather than in fear and violence, and to provide the intellectual foundation necessary to establish new societies of peace and justice; publishing what- ever triumphs these societies make, and mourning whenever and wherever they are oppressed. We will look back to the sources of Christianity in order to learn who we are, who God is, and how the world works, in order to learn the categories through which we can discuss what we must do in the present, so that we might become who we ought to be in the future.</P>
<P class="p10 ft3">We have prejudices. Here is an incomplete</P>
<P class="p11 ft4">list: Christianity is true. Christianity is about everything. Christianity is radical. Christianity leaves nothing alone. Christianity promises true freedom and true justice. Christianity undoes domination and does not buttress it. Greed is bad. Violence is bad. <NOBR>Self-interest</NOBR> is never enlightened. Wealth and power are dangerous and in consider- ations of their accumulation, all else is never equal.</P>
<P class="p9 ft3">We believe that Christ is the path to real, recognizable, and unequivocal freedom. We are not enamored with violence and power. We will have little patience for authoritarianism of any stripe. We do not believe that Christ is merely a</P>

<P class="p12 ft4">new variable that is inserted into a <NOBR>political-sci-</NOBR> ence machine. We believe that Christianity has changed the rules. Our investigations will be as much about figuring out those rules as it will be about turning the cultural tide.</P>
<P class="p13 ft3">Political Modernity is drawing to a close. We are in the midst of regime change. The fight between liberalism, socialism, and nationalism over what was once Christendom has ended. The language of ideological modernity is used now to obscure rather than expound our social world. This discourse is so saturated with interests and agendas, with narratives and <NOBR>counter-narratives,</NOBR> that it seems incapable of expressing anything other than tedious absurdities. It doesn’t work anymore.</P>
<P class="p14 ft4">Contemporary political rhetoric is an alter- nating mixture of inane platitude and insane invective, a rhetoric that tricks us into thinking we live in a world of real ideals and real debate, when, in fact, the relentless march of homogenization, standardization, monetization proceeds without pause. No one fights more viciously than warring pagan factions. In such a conflict, no one is right, and both sides are after the same thing.</P>
<P class="p15 ft4">It is precisely this decadence, however, that is the source of hope. As more and more of the lingering truths of Christianity are expunged, the banality of evil becomes ever clearer. It is not sophisticated; it is not complex; it is not fascinat- ing or compelling. It is silly and in bad taste. The idols of the pagan nations are ridiculous. They are obviously fashioned by human hands and worked for the advantage of corrupt elites, and yet they are centers of vast mechanisms of power, and so instill intense and justified fear. The irony, however, is that the more the idols become completely them- selves, the more they are readied to be knocked over and mocked as the mere wood and paint that they are. This is why our time is a time of hope. The absurdity of the current regime and the even greater absurdity of the next regime that is almost certainly displacing it are the conditions of possi- bility for a radical change, for a conversion. Such a change is in the air; people are looking for it, waiting for it.</P>
<P class="p16 ft3">May Christ bring it.</P>
