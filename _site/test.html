<h1>Ne w p l ag u e , n e w
regime, new magazine

Twentieth Century propaganda, sustained through the decades by countless
Hollywood productions, has conditioned us to believe that new regimes
arise through elaborate scams. Some sort of fake
crisis, internal threat, war-mongering enemy, or
faux economic hardship provides the excuse for an
enterprising political genius to grab power. This
political entrepreneur then wields the force of the
state over and against the population that he successfully duped.
This is not how it really happens. The power
of particular men is limited by and operates within
the will of the people who conform to its force. A
new regime may attempt to shape this power, use
it, or bend it in particular directions, but any sovereignty claimed by individual men is ultimately
derivative. The tyrant is as much the puppet as
the puppeteer. The basis of sustained power is in
the souls of the dominated, their habits, their fear,
their acquiescence. Real regime changes happen
here.
We are witnessing regime change. It is not a
conspiracy. The coronavirus is not a scam and the
efforts to contain it are not a veil hiding the real
power grab that is happening underneath. The
problem is real and the old regime isn’t working.
The imperative to isolate, the imperative to
social distance, is necessary exactly because we are
already more isolated than ever before, because we
are already more dissolved into a mass than any
humans in history. Our very interchangeability
is the condition of the virus’s devastation. The
only solution that will “work” is to push forward
to complete anonymity rather than back to social
embeddedness; to families and communities. It is
exactly our debt/consumption economic system
that has made us so economically vulnerable,
and the only solution that will “work” is to push
forward to the near total extinction of small-scale
capital ownership. The only thing that will “work”
is the reduction of the economy to businesses too
big to fail and the extension of the State beyond
the lingering pretext of the public/private binary.
The final move to reduce society to the consuming
individual and the capital-controlling State-Corporate conglomerate is what will “work.”
It will work, however, only because of the conformity that constitutes its power. The new regime
will not be imposed upon us by some scheming
elite — that’s a libertarian fantasy. We will be the
regime. Its sovereignty will come as much through
the new social mores, manners, and moral judgments that will reward anonymity and scale while
punishing community and intimacy as it will
through any legal or economic apparatus. Our
fear is real because the threat is real. And we will
form the power necessary to assuage our fear. This
power will include everything from explicit law
to the meaning of virtue, to the vision of a good
life, to what it means to be a responsible citizen,
friend, or parent. Our new leaders’ power will be a
participation in this power and not its source.
Understanding this allows us to understand
how liberalism tricked us with fables of popular
sovereignty, social contracts, and the consent
of the governed — as if the very mechanisms
through which all earthly power is wielded can
somehow serve as the guarantee that power will
be just and benevolent. Men are quite capable of
enslaving themselves. The “consent of the governed” may well include a wholehearted consent to
misery and oppression under the rule of wealthy
men playing god. Indeed, if we believe the Biblical
account, that is how slavery comes into being: The
power of the god-kings rested on the people’s fear
of idols, whose power was nothing else than the
people themselves.

letter from the editor
But thanks be to God — the politics of fear
and power are not our only option. The Bible
is clear about what the lords of the nations can
deliver, and it is not nothing. But it is also not
true peace. True peace is only possible by going
in the other direction, the direction taken by
“the birds of the air” and “the lilies of the field.”
Perhaps the coming regime will help Christians
remember this. Such a remembrance will likely
make us odious to the defenders of order. And
they will largely be right. Christianity is a threat
to the proper “working” of regimes of fear and
power, as the New Testament makes clear. Christianity is not yet another economy of power, yet
another sovereignty competing on the field of
battle. Christianity overcomes fear and power and
undoes the mechanisms of slavery. This is why the
Romans could not tolerate Christians. It is why
the Early Modern Liberals excepted Catholicism
from religions to be tolerated. They understood
the implication of Christianity better than do
most modern believers.
We are launching this magazine in order to do
our bit toward overthrowing the idols of our age,
to imagine a political order established in Christ,
rather than in fear and violence, and to provide the
intellectual foundation necessary to establish new
societies of peace and justice; publishing whatever triumphs these societies make, and mourning
whenever and wherever they are oppressed. We
will look back to the sources of Christianity in
order to learn who we are, who God is, and how
the world works, in order to learn the categories
through which we can discuss what we must do
in the present, so that we might become who we
ought to be in the future.
We have prejudices. Here is an incomplete
list: Christianity is true. Christianity is about
everything. Christianity is radical. Christianity
leaves nothing alone. Christianity promises true
freedom and true justice. Christianity undoes
domination and does not buttress it. Greed is bad.
Violence is bad. Self-interest is never enlightened.
Wealth and power are dangerous and in considerations of their accumulation, all else is never equal.
We believe that Christ is the path to real,
recognizable, and unequivocal freedom. We are
not enamored with violence and power. We will
have little patience for authoritarianism of any
stripe. We do not believe that Christ is merely a
new variable that is inserted into a political-science machine. We believe that Christianity has
changed the rules. Our investigations will be as
much about figuring out those rules as it will be
about turning the cultural tide.
Political Modernity is drawing to a close.
We are in the midst of regime change. The fight
between liberalism, socialism, and nationalism
over what was once Christendom has ended. The
language of ideological modernity is used now to
obscure rather than expound our social world.
This discourse is so saturated with interests and
agendas, with narratives and counter-narratives,
that it seems incapable of expressing anything
other than tedious absurdities. It doesn’t work
anymore.
Contemporary political rhetoric is an alternating mixture of inane platitude and insane
invective, a rhetoric that tricks us into thinking we
live in a world of real ideals and real debate, when,
in fact, the relentless march of homogenization,
standardization, monetization proceeds without
pause. No one fights more viciously than warring
pagan factions. In such a conflict, no one is right,
and both sides are after the same thing.
It is precisely this decadence, however, that
is the source of hope. As more and more of the
lingering truths of Christianity are expunged,
the banality of evil becomes ever clearer. It is not
sophisticated; it is not complex; it is not fascinating or compelling. It is silly and in bad taste. The
idols of the pagan nations are ridiculous. They are
obviously fashioned by human hands and worked
for the advantage of corrupt elites, and yet they are
centers of vast mechanisms of power, and so instill
intense and justified fear. The irony, however, is
that the more the idols become completely themselves, the more they are readied to be knocked
over and mocked as the mere wood and paint that
they are. This is why our time is a time of hope.
The absurdity of the current regime and the even
greater absurdity of the next regime that is almost
certainly displacing it are the conditions of possibility for a radical change, for a conversion. Such
a change is in the air; people are looking for it,
waiting for it.
May Christ bring it.
