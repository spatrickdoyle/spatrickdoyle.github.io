		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>An Interview with D. C. Schindler</h2><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><p class=""><strong>Robert Mixa (RM): Please help us understand the work of Ferdinand Ulrich and his philosophical importance.&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=""><strong>D. C. Schindler (DC)</strong>: He was a twentieth century German Catholic philosopher born in 1931 and died in February 2020. Even though we associate him with Hans Urs von Balthasar who died in 1988, Ulrich was much younger than him. In his latter years, Ulrich was living, more or less, in a life of seclusion, a life of prayer. He gave retreats, but was not active as a philosopher since the 1980s. He was a precocious philosophical genius, and he took to philosophy from a young age. He was interested mainly in the philosophy of Thomas Aquinas. It is right to think of him as a Thomist but a Thomist of a particular sort – I use the phrase “Speculative Thomist”. Many Thomists tend to be very historically-minded. They approach Aquinas mainly by mining texts and showing development, and that sort of thing. Ulrich reads Aquinas in a very different sort of way. He&nbsp; draws philosophical, metaphysical inspiration from the texts but engages with them in a very creative spirit, putting him into conversation with many other philosophers from the modern era. Heidegger and Hegel are important there, but this speculation, to my mind, is faithful to Aquinas. It is not twisting and bending Aquinas, as some think. But it’s faithful, bound to the spirit and letter of Aquinas.&nbsp;</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><p class="">RM: <strong>So he’s not cherry picking aspects of Aquinas’ thought but holistically engaging it?&nbsp;</strong></p></content:encoded>
