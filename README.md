This is my personal website.<br/>
I don't know how likely it is that anyone will ever read through the commit history of this 
repository, but just in case you do, I would like it to be know:<br/>
The convenience of hosting my website with GitHub is that all I have to do to update the site is 
push changes to the repository. This means that in order for me to test the website with 
different browsers and devices, the easiest way is to update the website. But when I do this, I 
am not always sure the changes I made will actually fix a problem or look good. As a result, 
there are several strings of commits that I made in a short amount of time where I'm just 
like<br/>
```
OK I fixed <problem>
```
```
No wait <problem> is still there, but this time it should be fixed
```
```
Crap its still there, this will probably fix it though
```
And so on. So yeah, I just thought I should offer an explanation for why that is a thing.<br/><br/>

TODO:<br/>
Home:<br/>
EVERYTHING needs to look prettier. I think its the fonts... all the text just looks blocky for some reason.<br/>
Should the banner be bigger? Or maybe scale with the other stuff, or put it in a box, or something.<br/>
Should I get rid of the slogan? Maybe come up with a new one.<br/>
Update the photo.<br/>
The dang name card still doesn't really look right. Maybe replace it with an image instead of having it be HTML.<br/>
Contact me button doesn't appear to be working at all.<br/>
About me:<br/>
Should probably update these pictures.<br/>
Update my majors (I have three now). Maybe rewrite the whole thing to be more relevant (see resume).<br/>
Could probably update skills too.<br/>
Contact info should say 'facebook messenger' not 'facebook message'.<br/>
Resume needs to be updated.<br/>
This website:<br/>
Rewrite and re-examine the spacing on EVERYTHING. It needs to look cleaner, and read better.<br/>
The captions trail off the screen, and their coloring isn't always consistent.<br/>
Make comments work.<br/>
Projects:<br/>
Project buttons could maybe be closer together.<br/>
Add new articles (in addition to rewriting the existing ones).<br/>
