	  <p><div id="body_text">
		  - This website was written and is maintained by me.<br/>
		  - It is composed purely of good old HTML and CSS, with a couple hundred lines of Javascript mixed in. I wanted to write it completely by hand as a sort of challenge to myself, to see if I was familiar enough with the basics of web development to get it done, and also because I wanted to have complete and total control over its look and feel.<br/>
		  - The primary purpose of this website is to demonstrate what I know. Resumes and interviews are all fine and good, but the best way to show what I know is to do stuff with it. I will be posting projects with the intention of showcasing my skills and giving a complete picture of my technical knowledge.<br/>
		  - This website will be continually updated as I learn more about web development and figure out how to make it look better. It's slowly inching toward professional, so look forward to that day.<br/>

		  <!--- The comment system is written in Javascript, and uses <a href="http://www.data.sparkfun.com">data.sparkfun.com</a> as a backend. Data.sparkfun.com is a data stream service that allows for easy pushing of data to the internet. Comments and their associated metadata are pushed to my stream, and retrieved when the page is loaded. The comment system is also integrated with Github. Users may enter their Github username, and the comment system uses the Github web API to pull data such as the user's location, name and avatar to personalize the comment.<br/>-->

		  - I purchased this domain name from Google Domains and I am hosting it on Github Pages. Hosting on Github is convenient because all I have to do to update it is push my repo, and all the code goes where it needs to and is open for anyone to see (<a href="https://github.com/spatrickdoyle/spatrickdoyle.github.io">check it out here</a>). Also, it's free!<br/>

		  - The icons and other assets were made by me.<br/>

		<div id="body_text">It's accurate - this website has nothing to do with Pokemon. But really, the primary reason that little subheading is there is because it looks good. Its origin is in the first version of this website - www.pokemonrevolution.me. I was at a 24-hour coding event in Kansas City in 2015, and my team was making a game that involved Pokemon making humans fight in a play on the classic video games that involve humans making Pokemon fight. Namecheap.com was also having a deal where participants in this event could register a free .me domain. We wanted to make a website for our game... so I registered pokemonrevolution.me. The project ended up not going anywhere, but I still used the domain for a while for other things. I wanted to make the website look good, so I made a div id="banner" at the top and came up with that little slogan. I purchased a more professional domain when I got around to the modern incarnation of this website, but the div id="banner" lives on as a slick looking sign of how this website has evolved.<br/><br/>

		  Why spatrickdoyle.com? It sounds professional. Also, seandoyle.com wasn't available.<br/><br/>

		  As I mentioned, the original website was registered with Namecheap, and it was hosted on Google Drive. Google has since removed webhosting capabilities from Drive, but it was nice for a while.<br/></div><br/><br/>--><a name="philosophy"></a>

		<div id="paragraph">&nbsp;My thoughts on web design</div><br/>

		<div id="body_text">I spent a lot of time thinking about and working on the design of this website. I wanted to focus on the central idea of a good user interface: a UI needs to be simple enough that it is intuitive, but not so simple it doesn't actually accomplish what it is supposed to. I paid careful attention to the layout of other websites I commonly visited, and I thought about what kind of experience I had with these websites. Above all, I wanted to achieve the concise and efficient delivery of information - but in a way that looked really slick.<br/><br/>

		  I noticed that a lot of websites conform to three common layouts, and I'm going to briefly discuss the pros and cons of each.</div><br/>

		<div id="paragraph">&nbsp;The 'HTML5' Look</div><br/>

		<div id="body_text">Websites of this style are fairly common nowadays. A website of this style is sometimes only one page, or will have a few pages of the same layout. All the information in the page, including links, pictures, comment boxes, embedded videos... is laid out in one, long page you scroll down. It will usually have animations and other flashy graphics, which is why I associate it with HTML5.</div><br/>

		  </figcaption>
		</figure><br/>

		<div id="body_text">I find this style annoying, because it doesn't index information in an intuitive way. You have to scroll through the whole thing to try to find what you want, and since the amount of actual content on the page is usually sacrificed for the sake of looking good, websites that take this form are often frustratingly uninformative. This might make a good design for something like a brief introduction to a product, but if I want more detailed information about an event or product, the website should not be organized in this way.<br/><br/>

		  This could also be a fine design for mobile websites, where the screen is so much smaller a completely different design is necessitated, but just because it works well on a mobile device doesn't mean it will in a normal browser. Overall, this is a trend I have tried to avoid.</div><br/>

		<div id="paragraph">&nbsp;The Labyrinth</div><br/>

		<div id="body_text">If you've ever applied to college you'll know what I'm talking about here. Go to any college website, and it doesn't matter what you're looking for - statistics about getting it, detailed bios of the professors, what the requirements are to apply... it will not be easy to find. This is because they have so much information on the website, but they don't index it properly. They don't think about what people coming to the website will actually be looking for, so you get a bunch of links to pages that don't really fit what you're trying to find. They have too much information to easily keep track of, so you end up with duplicate pages or broken links or multiple pages that describe the same thing but in different contexts. Trying to do research on a school can lead you into a vast maze of subdomains and stub pages.</div><br/>

		  </figcaption>
		</figure><br/>

		<div id="body_text">There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with this style of website, at first glance. But again, when a focus on how the website looks on the surface takes precedence over efficiently organizing information, it leads to an <i>extremely</i> frustrating experience for the user.</div><br/>

		<div id="paragraph">&nbsp;Columns</div><br/>

		<div id="body_text">So what about websites that do a good job with their layout? I've found that I have the best user experience when websites are laid out in columns, with navigation moving from the left to the right. What do I mean by this? I think Spotify is a great example.</div><br/>

		<figure>
		  <img src="img/spotify_scrot.png" alt=""/>
		  <figcaption>
			Now that's a good looking webpage
		  </figcaption>
		</figure><br/>

		<div id="body_text">Base navigation is in a column on the far left. This is good because no matter where you navigate within the website, the menu is right there, unchanging. The main space in the center is where all the action happens. With Spotify specifically, as you navigate through menus, previous pages slide to the left and sort of pile up, so you can see where you just were and easily get back to it. And finally, the far right pane has the most detailed and low level information: what song is playing, and the relevant controls. Pretty much everything the user would want to see is on the screen at any given time, the controls are intuitive, and navigation is easy. I always find websites of this design to by easy and pleasant to use. Other examples of this style include GroupMe, Discord, and this website (which I specifically modeled with these ideas in mind).<br/><br/>

		  These are just my thoughts on this topic. With all the powerful web technology we have nowadays, it seems crazy how many websites are just a pain to navigate. Hopefully this website does not fall into that catagory - but if you have any suggestions, shoot me an email.</div>
