		  For this class, we were challenged to create a device that could throw a ping pong ball at a target. Both the balls and the target were covered in velcro, and points were awarded based on distance and accuracy.<br/><br/>

		  We discussed a few different means of throwing the ping pong balls, but quickly decided upon a crossbow design with the idea that it would be the most accurate. Considering the materials we had available, we recognized that plywood board is not flexible enough for a true crossbow design, so instead the force on the ball will be generated by rubber bands.</div><br/>

		<div id="paragraph">&nbsp;3D Printed Parts</div><br/>

		<div id="body_text">The primary mechanic of our design was that the ball was shot from a 3D-printed pipe. The pipe ensures that the ball moves in a straight line and stays accurate. Rubber bands ran through a cut in the center of the pipe to exert maximum force on the ball.</div><br/>

		<div id="body_text">Running through the pipe there was another 3D printed piece that the rubber bands actually attached to, which slides along to propel the ball.</div><br/>

		<div id="body_text">In the center of the plug there is a small hook, which connects to a paper clip for the purpose of holding back the ball until the mechanism is fired.</div><br/>

		<div id="paragraph">&nbsp;Firing Mechanism</div><br/>

		<div id="body_text">By far the most difficult component to design was the firing mechanism. It was required as part of the challenge that the device must be triggered by another ping pong ball, which posed a problem, as any piece capable of holding back the intense force of the rubber bands will most likely not be able to be released with only the weight of a ping pong ball.</div><br/>

			Our initial ideas for the trigger mechanism
		  </figcaption>
		</figure><br/>

		<div id="body_text">It seemed clear to us that the dropping of the ping pong ball must trigger a heavier object to fall, and that heavier object would trigger the actual launch.<br/><br/>

		  We came up with two different ideas for a trigger, both following the same principle of using a ping pong ball to trigger a heavier object. The ideas was that if the first design failed, we would have a second to try.</div><br/>

		<div id="body_text">In order to ensure that the rubber bands we used would have enough force, we built a makeshift slingshot to see how far the bands would send the ball. Our specifications were based on calculations we did that modeled the rubber bands. Assuming rubber bands conform to Hookeâ€™s law for springs, we measured the spring constants of multiple kinds of rubber bands using a force gauge and compiled a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UeHOQtxFThwR9w9eSSpcJCddBSjylN4Iivcxxmn3W0c/edit?usp=sharing">spreadsheet to simulate our design</a>. Happy with the results, we proceeded with our design.</div><br/>

		<div id="body_text">We completed the design by laser cutting the body out of MDF and hot gluing everything together. We wanted to use the strongest possible rubber bands in order to throw the ball as far as we could. Unfortunately, the rubber bands we chose seemed to be too strong, and kept breaking parts of our launcher. The arms that stuck off the side of our 3D printed plug worked for a while, but eventually broke. We then printed a new one with thicker arms, and it broke as well. We printed a third one that we reinforced as much as we possibly could, and it broke after only a couple shots. We then took this plug and drilled a hole through it where the arms were, and inserted a 3/8 inch piece of wooden dowel, thinking this would be stronger than the ABS plastic. Again, this worked for a little while, but after we broke three or four pieces of dowel we decided it wasn't a sustainable solution. We eventually used paper clips in place of the dowel, since they were both strong and flexible, and could be easily replaced if they broke.</div><br/>

		<div id="body_text">The trigger mechanism consists of a lever with a paper clip sticking of the end. The paper clip loops around the hook on the back of the plug, and when the back of the lever is pressed down, the mechanism fires. One of the criteria for this competition was that the trigger must be activated by dropping another ping pong ball on it. Unfortunately, due to the tension of the rubber bands, our trigger required quite a bit more force than this, and we only successfully fired it once in competition.</div>
