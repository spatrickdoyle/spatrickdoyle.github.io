Picked a laptop
acquired old laptop for testing
installed xp
tried to install ubuntu and overwrite with arch - good thing i did this, i overwrote the proper grub configuration information
tried again, copied /boot/grub onto a flash drive and gave it all the permissions, installed grub and copied the config directory into /boot, and modified grub.cfg to change every instance of 'ubuntu' to 'arch'
didn't work, modified grub.cfg again to reflect the new partition
it booted, but it appeared to have some problems. I got back into chroot from the usb drive to install dialog, iw, and wpa_supplicant because i forgot to before and the internet was being sketchy
i also forgot to make a user and add me to the sudoers file
pgp keys were messed up, fixed it but it was hanging so i had to bang on the keyboard
didnt reboot at first, gave an error, probably a result of fogetting sudo
was getting a device warning on boot, fixed by changing 3 instances of ro to rw in grub.cfg
getting another device warning at boot, but the internet says it is harmless, so...
X wouldn't start, turned out I installed the wrong drivers (I'm lame)
But after all that it works!

Tried out windows, it runs fine
Disabled fast boot
Entered uefi menu by pressing shift, disabled secure boot
changed boot order to usb first
Shrunk the main windows partition to create space
booted ubuntu
partitioned out 98 Gb for / and 2 for swap
installed ubuntu
copied /boot/grub to flash drive
installed arch and grub
copied /boot/grub in and changed grub.cfg
booting drops me into grub recovery console without an error
apparently this won't work in UEFI because it needs an EFI partition...
went about dual booting the old fashioned way - adding a custom menu entry to /etc/grub.d/40_custom
it worked!
