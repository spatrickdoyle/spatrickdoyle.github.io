This is my personal website.<br/>
I don't know how likely it is that anyone will ever read through the commit history of this 
repository, but just in case you do, I would like it to be know:<br/>
The convenience of hosting my website with GitHub is that all I have to do to update the site is 
push changes to the repository. This means that in order for me to test the website with 
different browsers and devices, the easiest way is to update the website. But when I do this, I 
am not always sure the changes I made will actually fix a problem or look good. As a result, 
there are several strings of commits that I made in a short amount of time where I'm just 
like<br/>
```
OK I fixed <problem>
```
```
No wait <problem> is still there, but this time it should be fixed
```
```
Crap its still there, this will probably fix it though
```
And so on. So yeah, I just thought I should offer an explanation for why that is a thing.<br/><br/>
